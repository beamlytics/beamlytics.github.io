# Beamlytics

Beamlytics is a new start up based out of Bentonville, Arkansas! We started our journey in Feb 2024.

Beamlytics vision is to help retailers adopt data-driven, AI/ML based strategy to improve their customers' life, while not impacting bottom line. To achive this, our first pledge to keep our software code always free and open-source.

Stay tuned for our more product launch announcements!!
