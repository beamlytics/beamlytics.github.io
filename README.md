# Beamlytics

Beamlytics is a new start up based out of Bentonville, Arkansas! We started our journey in Feb 2024.

Beamlytics's vision is to help retailers adopt data-driven, AI/ML based strategy to improve their customers' life, while not impacting bottom line. 
To achieve this, our first pledge is to keep our software code always free and open-source.

Stay tuned for our product launch announcements!!
