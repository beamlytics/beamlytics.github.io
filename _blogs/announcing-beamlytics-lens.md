<img src="/images/Beamlytics_Lens.jpg" alt="Beamlytics Lens" width="500"/>


<em>The retail landscape is changing faster than ever.</em> Customers expect a seamless shopping experience across all channels, from online browsing to in-store purchases. But staying ahead of the curve can be tough, especially when it comes to data analytics.

## The Data Challenge in Retail

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards online shopping. In fact, according to McKinsey, the top 25 performing retailers, who are mostly digital leaders, saw 83% higher profits than their competitors.

*What's their secret weapon?* It is undoubtedly the usage of advanced analytics.

But many retailers struggle to implement these tools due to several challenges.

| Challenge Area  | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Fear of the unknown**  | Some companies are hesitant to embrace data-driven decisions.  |
| **Organizational hurdles**  |  Balancing centralized and decentralized data can be tricky.  |
| **Talent shortage**  |   Finding skilled data specialists can be difficult, especially for smaller businesses. |
|  **Inefficient processes** |  Analytics projects can get bogged down by delays and unclear priorities.  |
| **Outdated systems** | Legacy systems often struggle to handle the massive amount of data available today. |
|  **Poor data management**|  Data silos and lack of organization can make it hard to gain valuable insights.  |
